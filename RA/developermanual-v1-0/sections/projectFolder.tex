\section{Project Folder}
%The project folder is organized in the following way: there are 
The project folder contains the following subfolders:
\begin{itemize}
	\item\verb|contracts|: it contains the blockchain contracts written in the Solidity programming language
    \item\verb|migrations|: it contains javascript files that help you deploy contracts to the Ethereum network. These files are
    responsible for staging your deployment tasks, and they're written under the assumption that your deployment needs will change over time.
    As your project evolves, you'll create new migration scripts to further this evolution on the blockchain.

    \item\verb|api|: it  contains all the \emph{adapters} to the external API such as \verb|IPFS| and \verb|web3|;
    \item\verb|public|: it contains some media files, such as images, that can be accessible as external source;
    \item\verb|scripts|: it contains files (build.js, start.js, test.js) written to compile and to create the local execution workspace for
    	\project;
    \item\verb|src|: it contains the part of the project related to the frontend development;
    \item\verb|webpack|: it contains webpack, a static module bundler for JavaScript. It internally builds a dependency graph 
    which maps every module needed by the project and generates one or more bundles

\end{itemize}
The folders \verb|scripts| and \verb|webpack| are responsible for getting the application start, test and build. If you are not confident with the settings of the \emph{truffle} framework and the \emph{webpack} package it's recommended to not modify those files.
