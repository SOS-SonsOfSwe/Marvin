\section{Professors}
After the login you will notice that a black bar has appeared near the top of the screen.
The black bar contains on its left the voice \textbf{Exams list}.

If you click on that voice, you will be redirected to a page (similar to the one in Figure~\ref{fig:professorExamsList}) that shows you the exams associated to you.
