\subsection*{E}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{EVM}: the EVM is the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Ethereum is a platform intended to allow users to easily write decentralized applications (\DH apps) that use blockchain technology. The EVM can be thought of as a large decentralized computer containing millions of objects, called ''accounts'', which have the   ability   to   maintain   an   internal   database,   execute   code   and   communicate   to   each   other.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{D}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{\DH app}: a \DH app, also called \emph{decentralized application},distributed application like any others (hence composed of multiple parts) but with the distinguishing property that each part is individually able to do its job without depending on the other parts The application has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers. A \DH app can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as IPFS. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{M}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Metamask}: it is an Ethereum Wallet that lets you run Ethereum's \DH app directly from your browser.
\end{itemize}
