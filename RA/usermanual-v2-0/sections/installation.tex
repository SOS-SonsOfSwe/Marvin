\subsubsection{Transactions}
If you write some data on the Ethereum blockchain then you're doing a transaction, so you have to pay using cryptocurrency. You need to use Metamask to confirm every transaction.

The opened window is similar to the one in Figure~\ref{fig:transaction}, to complete tha transaction you have to click on the \textbf{Submit} button.
