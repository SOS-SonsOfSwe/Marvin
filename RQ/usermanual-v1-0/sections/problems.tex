\section{Problems with the software}
The member of the \Group{} group did their best to create \project{}, including an extensive testing and debugging phase. Unfortunately, as E.W. Dijkstra used to say, ''Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence''. For this reason it is possible, even if we hope not, that the program contains some bugs.

\subsection{Error reporting}
You can report malfunctions to the mail address {\href{mailto:sonsofswe.swe@gmail.com}{sonsofswe.swe@gmail.com}} or at the \project{} repository on github (\url{https://github.com/SOS-SonsOfSwe/Marvin-SoS/issues}).

If you want to write an email to report an error, then you must insert in the \emph{Subject} of the mail the tag [ERROR]. 
\subsubsection{Error reporting informations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The type of  involved user (university, admin, teacher, student);
