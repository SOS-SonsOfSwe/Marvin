\subsection*{D}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{\DH app }: a \DH app, also called \emph{decentralized application}, is an application that has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers. A \DH app can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as IPFS.	
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{M}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Metamask}: it is an Ethereum Wallet that lets you run Ethereum's \DH app directly from your browser.
